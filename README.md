This program is a work in progress, but works for quizzes provided the right guidelines are followed.

Your quiz file needs to be referenced in the file config.properties for the program to be able to read it.

A $ sign is required to be placed straight after the correct answer in a multi-choice question for the program to be able to determine the correct answer.

When defining multiple choice answers the program currently works with only the . and ) symbols for answers.

To run your quiz you currently need to use a command window and change the directory to where the quiz program is located.
Then enter the following line into the cmd.

java QuizProgram

This should run the program and allow you to start testing yourself. The quiz questions will appear in the command window and from there you can answer them and test yourself.
